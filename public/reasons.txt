you're someone I could come home to
you usually can tell how i'm feeling
you genuinely listen to me
you tell me about all your interests
you listen to my inane nerd rambling
you called me a huge loser but also cool
you tell me when something's wrong
you'll do anything with me
I can tell you care about me
the shine I see in your eyes
your smile
your hair
your tits
your ass
your tummy
you're so strong, for just being alive after everything
you don't just dissapear if I make a mistake
the hugs you give
your exprpessions
your face (and its shape)
you're down to cuddle whenever
