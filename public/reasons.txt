you're someone I could come home to
you usually can tell how i'm feeling
you genuinely listen to me
you tell me about all your interests
you listen to my inane nerd rambling
you called me a huge loser but also cool
you tell me when something's wrong
you'll do anything with me
I can tell you care about me
the shine I see in your eyes
your smile
your hair
your tits
your ass
your tummy
you're so strong, for just being alive after everything
you don't just dissapear if I make a mistake
the hugs you give
your exprpessions
your face (and its shape)
you're down to cuddle whenever
your lips
your insanely cute blush
you're still here even though I've made many mistakes
you actually consider me to be worth something
you hold my hand in class sometimes
you care how your words affect me
you understand when plans don't go too well
you're honest with me even if you think I might get mad
your everything
sometimes I look at you and it feels like you genuinely see me
you took the time to come to this website
you don't laugh at my music
you help me in class if I'm struggling
you understand if I be nerd when you're over
you bring me things like food just because you thought of me
I can tell you think and care about me even on your own time
you said you'd follow me anywhere
the way you say you're in love with me
you are my sunshine
you're okay whether I want surgery or not
you don't mind doing kinda gross things for mee
you're comfortable being vulnerable with me
you said you feel safe with me
WE BE GETTING APARTMENT WOOOO

mmmmmm yummy lips
the way you taste
